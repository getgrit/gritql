This page collects information about the GritQL runtime.

## Randomness

The GritQL runtime uses a _static_ seed for built-in random functions like [random](/language/functions#random) and [shuffle](/language/functions#shuffle).

This makes the runtime more deterministic, which is useful for testing and debugging, but means you should _not_ use these functions for security purposes or for anything expecting true randomness.
