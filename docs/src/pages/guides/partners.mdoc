Projects can be linked at
`https://app.grit.io/projects/<org-name>/<repo-name>/branches/main`.

This will prompt the user to log in, and then redirect them to the project
report. Their access will mirror what they have on GitHub.

If you want to allow users to view a project report _without_ having access to
the GitHub repository, you will need to append a `vouch` to the URL. See
directions below for more information.

## How to generate a voucher

As a partner, you are able to vouch for users by appending a voucher token to
links you generate.

When you are onboarded as a partner, you will be given a private key that you
can use to sign tokens. You are also given a name.

**It is very important that you not leak your private key. It should only be
used server-side, never client-side.**

1. Choose the set of claims you want to include in the token. Claims are
   JSON-encoded. A typical claim that the user is allowed to access repo a repo
   is:

   ```json
   {
     "claims": [
       {
         "repo": "custodian-sample-org/sample-repo"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Sign the claims using your private key to generate a JWT. Make sure to set
   the `issuer` to your name.

   For example, [in Node.js](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) you
   could sign like this:

   ```javascript
   var token = jwt.sign(
     {
       claims: [
         {
           repo: 'custodian-sample-org/sample-repo',
         },
       ],
     },
     privateKey,
     { algorithm: 'RS256', issuer: 'sample-partner' },
   );
   ```

3. You can use the resulting token in a link to the user. Simply attach it as
   the `vouch` querystring. For example, to link to the report for the repo
   `custodian-sample-org/sample-repo`, you could use:

   ```text
   https://app.powder.dev/projects/custodian-sample-org/sample-repo/branches/main?vouch=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjbGFpbXMiOlt7InJlcG8iOiJjdXN0b2RpYW4tc2FtcGxlLW9yZy9qdWljZS1zaG9wIn1dLCJpYXQiOjE2NjEzODQzMTYsImlzcyI6InNhbXBsZSJ9.ZLyNIJDkw-tx_Ihu5An3D8y0jyetyWxT0vcedY04UUxFOvwhl2RqE4Jl4m2lJEYwatnzTe5Z34gIYv93dcfFfUex-87e_muq8H2ZpIaUsJB9Q-lVJN-xj6c86yFnYtQqqvUhRghZQUPlGPCzLbs3gRvcrDLUjZfK-rrzA3ZOPfe1uKlYJBMmI9jNZ_ec2yF9ftfyXurSfh_12R_tL0KW5vzdEQh1JrXkFsbu_OYAxJDRImnFOtU9_a2y8EzDP_Y5bW_BJKTpw8GCsa2_vNDqKaKTPu6xQSBNjtuxceiT1DwdkQktTz2Phzok5z_y4EvUkUi11XKAIgUoCdkESy2nxHv-KNKokuusKJS3N00jitMHKqxbmda1N9V_81y4HvIo2mvwWU8HYBPo8oj2KIfLVzYLfyPZsi48ECI5gmJxjjyniInLn9Z2h9DfIbTPuTFyApcoAFuxmCn9Pc6S-f93eyxu_hD1XDcctoaOOUNbBCE0Zi_pe0gkP7FhqT-EVE7XIUaBdhTJusXr7n8MGFwyMv6kNTXSWexncG9yylDvdoB-4qxafH-o73yIUpT85lyLgsGEeBu4gH0r2QZXz8N65bjvNe-_6TobET0Vt84cPoSML4r7Dhs4dgQgSQHDeVX5hnd4OWtI0gDmxWqxz8EtwWSRmx7sCRrKDdR1U7FLkSc
