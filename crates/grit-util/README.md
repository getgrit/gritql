# `grit-util`

This crate contains miscellaneous utility functions and types that are used
throughout the GritQL engine. It is intended to be a catch-all for things that
don't fit neatly into other crates, without taking any dependencies on other `grit` crates.

See the [GritQL homepage](https://docs.grit.io/language/overview) for more information about GritQL.
