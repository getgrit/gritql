/// TODO: Improve performance. Equivalence checks happen often so we want them to
/// be fast. The current implementation requires a traversal of the tree on all
/// named fields, which can be slow for large nodes. It also creates a cursor
/// at each traversal step.

/// Potential improvements:
/// 1. Use cursors that are passed as arguments -- not clear if this would be faster.
/// 2. Precompute hashes on all nodes, which define the equivalence relation. The check then becomes O(1).
