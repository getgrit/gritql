Rust grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)

## Features

- **Speed** — When initially parsing a file, `tree-sitter-rust` takes around twice
  as long as Rustc's hand-coded parser.

  ```sh
  $ wc -l examples/ast.rs
    2157 examples/ast.rs

  $ rustc -Z ast-json-noexpand -Z time-passes examples/ast.rs | head -n1
    time: 0.007    parsing # (7 ms)

  $ tree-sitter parse examples/ast.rs --quiet --time
    examples/ast.rs    16 ms
  ```

  But if you _edit_ the file after parsing it, this parser can generally _update_
  the previous existing syntax tree to reflect your edit in less than a millisecond,
  thanks to Tree-sitter's incremental parsing system.
