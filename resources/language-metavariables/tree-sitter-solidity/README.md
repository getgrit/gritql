> ðŸ’¡ this grammar is still in development, the structure of the generated AST is not stable

This repository contains a grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

The goal of this project is to provide an parser efficient low-dependency parser for solidity which targets most solidity versions in use and is designed for enabling metaprogramming.
